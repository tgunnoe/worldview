<p>Temporal coverage: 18 November 2013 - present</p>
<p>The AIRS Carbon Monoxide (CO) Total Column (Night) layer indicates the amount of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the total vertical column profile of the atmosphere (from Earthâ€™s surface to top-of-atmosphere) and is measured in parts per billion by volume (ppbv).</p>
<p>Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a poisonous, odorless and colorless gas. CO is produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning.  It is a strong greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming. It is one of the longest-lived, naturally occurring atmospheric carbon compounds. AIRS data have provided detailed, daily global observation of transport of mid-tropospheric CO from biomass burning emissions.</p>
<p>The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is an instrument on board the Aqua satellite. The AIRS Carbon Monoxide Total Column science parameter is a parameter of the AIRS Level 2 standard retrieval product using AIRS and AMSU (AIRX2RET_NRT). The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 45 km. The temporal resolution is daily.</p>
