<p>The SEDAC Reservoirs layer indicates the location of reservoirs around the world. It is part of the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.1.</p>
<p>The Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.1 contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 cubic km. The reservoirs were delineated from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. While the main focus was to include all reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers, many smaller reservoirs were added where data were available.</p>
<p>The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/grand-v1-reservoirs-rev01">Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)</a>, which also provides the area of the reservoir.</p>
