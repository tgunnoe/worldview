<p>This layer provides the extent of urban and rural areas in the 10m Low Elevation Coastal Zone around the world. It is part of the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) Urban-Rural Population and Land Area Estimates, Version 2 data set.</p>
<p>The Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) was derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 3 arc second (~90m) data which were post processed by ISciences LLC to include only elevations less than 20m contiguous to coastlines; and to supplement SRTM data in northern and southern latitudes.  The full data set includes population and land area statistics summarized at the low coastal elevations of less than or equal to 1m, 3m, 5m, 7m, 9m, 10m, 12m, and 20m. Additionally, estimates are provided for elevations &gt; 20m, and nationally. Urban and rural areas are differentiated by the GRUMPv1 Urban Extents.</p>
<p>The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lecz-urban-rural-population-land-area-estimates-v2">Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)</a>.</p>
