# OMI Upper tropospheric and Stratospheric SO2 column  

This is a gridded Level-2 OMI/Aura Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) Total Column (OMSO2) daily composite images of one of the 4 different estimates of the column density of SO2, STL (obtained by making different assumptions about the vertical distribution of the SO2). 

Upper tropospheric and Stratospheric SO2 column (STL), usually produced by explosive volcanic eruption, corresponding to CMA of 17 km. Note that OMI becomes more sensitive to SO2 above clouds and snow/ice, and less sensitive to SO2 below clouds. The image data is composed by gridding the available Level 2 data for a day into ¼ degree by ¼ degree grid and when the Solar Zenith Angle is less than 84.0 degrees Latitude. When pixels overlaps the mean path length is used to choose the best pixel. In addition all data is filtered for the row anomaly. Image data is provided in Dobson Units.
