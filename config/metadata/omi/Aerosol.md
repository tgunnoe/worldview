### Aerosol Optical Depth
Aerosols absorb and scatter incoming sunlight, which reduces visibility and increases the optical depth. Aerosols have an effect on human health, weather and the climate. Sources of aerosols include pollution from factories, smoke from fires, dust from dust storms, sea salts, and volcanic ash and smog. Aerosols compromise human health when inhaled by people with asthma or other respiratory illnesses. Aerosols also have an affect on the weather and climate by cooling or warming the earth, helping or preventing clouds from forming.

### Aerosol Optical Depth (Extinction, Near-UV, 388.0 nm)
Temporal Coverage: 1 October 2004 - Present

The OMI Aerosol Optical Depth (Extinction, Near-UV, 388.0 nm) is one of the parameters contained in the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 UV/VIS Aerosol product (OMAERUVd) product. The parameter is a dimensionless measure of the extinction of light by aerosols due to the combined effect of scattering and absorption. It indicates the level at which particles in the air (aerosols) prevent light (extinction of light) from traveling through the atmosphere.

The OMAERUVd product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km and sensor/algorithm resolution of 1.0 x 1.0 degrees.

### Aerosol Optical Depth (Absorbing, Near-UV, 388.0 nm)
Temporal Coverage: 1 October 2004 - Present

The OMI Aerosol Optical Depth (Absorbing, Near-UV, 388.0 nm) is one of the parameters contained in the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 UV/VIS Aerosol product (OMAERUVd) product, using a near-UV algorithm. This layer displays the degree to which airborne particles (aerosols) prevent the transmission of light through the process of absorption (attenuation) and is a unitless quantity. The aerosols that are most prevalent in this layer are desert dust and aerosols related to biomass burning.

The OMAERUVd product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km and sensor/algorithm resolution of 1.0 x 1.0 degrees.

### Aerosol Optical Depth (Absorbing, Multi-Wavelength, 388.0 nm)
Temporal Coverage: 1 October 2004 - Present

The OMI Aerosol Optical Depth (Absorbing, Multi-Wavelength, 388.0 nm) is one of the parameters contained in the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 UV/VIS Aerosol product (OMAEROe) product, using a multi-wavelength algorithm. The layer displays the degree to which airborne particles (aerosols) prevent the transmission of light through the process of absorption (attenuation) and is a unitless quantity.

The OMAEROe product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km and sensor/algorithm resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees.

### Aerosol Index
Temporal Coverage: 1 October 2004 – present

The OMI Aerosol Index layer indicates the presence of ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing particles in the air (aerosols) such as desert dust and soot particles in the atmosphere. The Aerosol Index layer is useful for identifying and tracking the long-range transport of volcanic ash from volcanic eruptions, smoke from wildfires or biomass burning events and dust from desert dust storms, even tracking over clouds and areas of snow and ice.

The OMI Aerosol Index layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 2 Near UV Aerosol Optical Depth and Single Scattering Albedo Swath 13x24 km (OMAERUV) available from the OMI instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
