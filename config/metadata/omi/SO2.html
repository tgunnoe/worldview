<p>Temporal coverage: 8 May 2012 – present</p>
<p>The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer indicates the column density of  sulfur dioxide in the lower troposphere (corresponding to 2.5 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). Sulfur Dioxide and Aerosol Index products are used to monitor volcanic clouds and detect pre-eruptive volcanic degassing globally. This information is used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers in advisories to airlines for operational decisions.</p>
<p>The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 2 Total Column Sulfur Dioxide (OMSO2) dataset, available from the OMI instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 8 May 2012 – present.</p>
<h1 id="omi-sulfur-dioxide-so2-middle-troposphere">OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Middle Troposphere</h1>
<p>Temporal coverage: 8 May 2012 – present</p>
<p>The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Middle Troposphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the middle troposphere (corresponding to 7.5 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). Sulfur Dioxide and Aerosol Index products are used to monitor volcanic clouds and detect pre-eruptive volcanic degassing globally. This information is used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers in advisories to airlines for operational decisions.</p>

<p>Temporal coverage: 8 May 2012 – present</p>
<p>The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the upper troposphere and stratosphere (corresponding to 17 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). Sulfur Dioxide and Aerosol Index products are used to monitor volcanic clouds and detect pre-eruptive volcanic degassing globally.
