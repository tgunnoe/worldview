<p>Temporal Coverage: 1 October 2004 - Present</p>
<p>The OMI Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) tropospheric parameter displays the tropospheric component of the total NO2 column measured in molecules/cm2. Nitrogen dioxide is an important chemical species in both, the stratosphere where it plays a key role in ozone chemistry, and in the troposphere where it is a precursor to ozone production. In the troposphere, it is produced in various combustion processes and in lightning and is an indicator of poor air quality and urban smog.</p>
<p>The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 NO2 (OMNO2d) product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km and sensor/algorithm resolution where pixel level data of good quality are binned and &quot;averaged&quot; into 0.25 x 0.25 degree global grids.</p>
