<p>This is a gridded Level-2 OMI/Aura Near-UV Aerosol Absorption and Extinction Optical Depth and Single Scattering Albedo (OMAERUV) daily composite images for the UV aerosol index (UVAI) at 354, 388 and 500 nm. </p>
<p>The UVAI has become an invaluable tool for tracking long-range transport of absorbing aerosols (smoke and dust) throughout the globe, even when the aerosols are over clouds. The Level 2 data is filtered for Solar Zenith Angle less than 84.0 for for the row anomaly using the row anomaly. </p>
<p>The map is refreshed every 100 minutes and the map is about 3 hours behind the real time.</p>
