# OMI Absorbing Aerosol Optical Depth  

This is a gridded Level-2 OMI/Aura Near-UV Aerosol Absorption and Extinction Optical Depth and Single Scattering Albedo (OMAERUV) daily composite images for aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) at 354, 388 and 500 nm. 

AOD is a dimensionless measure of the extinction of light by aerosols due to the combined effect of scattering and absorption, while AAOD is that due to aerosol absorption only. The AAOD is the most reliable quantitative OMAERUV aerosol parameter since AAOD is insensitive to clouds. The Level 2 data is filtered for Solar Zenith Angle less than 84.0 for for the row anomaly using the row anomaly. 

The map is refreshed every 100 minutes and the map is about 3 hours behind the real time.
