<p>This is a gridded Level-2 OMI/Aura Near-UV Aerosol Absorption and Extinction Optical Depth and Single Scattering Albedo (OMAERUV) daily composite images for aerosol extinction optical depth (AOD) at 354, 388 and 500 nm. </p>
<p>AOD is a dimensionless measure of the extinction of light by aerosols due to the combined effect of scattering and absorption, while AAOD is that due to aerosol absorption only. For environments where cloud free conditions prevail the AOD can be reliably retrieved. Cloud interference with satellite retrieval is minimal over arid and semi-arid regions where dust aerosols are commonly present. Clear skies are also frequent in areas of seasonal biomass burning and forest fires in the vicinity of the sources. As the plumes of dust and smoke aerosols drift away from their source regions, they mixed with clouds and the OMAERUV AOD retrieval becomes very challenging. The Level 2 data is filtered for Solar Zenith Angle less than 84.0 for for the row anomaly using the row anomaly. </p>
