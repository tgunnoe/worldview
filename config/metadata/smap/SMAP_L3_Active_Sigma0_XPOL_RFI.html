<p>Temporal coverage: 13 April 2015 - 7 July 2015</p>
<p>The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) &quot;Sigma0 3 km RFI (L3, Active, XPOL Polarization&quot; layer displays Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) quality flags of backscatter posted on a 3 km EASE-Grid 2.0 for and the cross-polarizations (XPOL) from the SMAP radar. RFI refers to the interference in measurements from other transmitters operating at frequencies in and adjacent to the SMAP L-band frequency.</p>
<p>Within the image, green indicates that Sigma0 observations are free of RFI and approved for science use, yellow indicates that caution should be used with the Sigma0 observations as RFI was detected but mitigated, and red indicates that Sigma0 observations are flagged as bad due to RFI.</p>
<p>The SMAP spacecraft carries two instruments, a radar (active) and a radiometer (passive), that together make global measurements of land surface soil moisture and freeze/thaw state. It is useful for monitoring and predicting natural hazards such as floods and droughts, understanding the linkages between Earthâ€™s water, energy and carbon cycles, and reducing uncertainties in predicting weather and climate.</p>
