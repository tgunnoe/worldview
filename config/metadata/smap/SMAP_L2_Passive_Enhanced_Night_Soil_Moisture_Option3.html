<p>Temporal coverage: 31 March 2015 - present</p>
<p>The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) &quot;Soil Moisture 9 km (L2, Passive, Night, Dual Channel Algorithm)&quot; layer displays surface soil moisture in cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> derived from the Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA), one of four optional soil moisture algorithms, for the 6:00 p.m. ascending (Night) half-orbit passes of the SMAP radiometer. The SMAP radiometer measures natural thermal emission emanating from the soil surface. To enhance the grid resolution, Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation techniques are used to extract maximum information from SMAP antenna temperatures and convert them to brightness temperatures, which are posted to the 9 km EASE-Grid 2.0. In the DCA, both the vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures are used to solve for soil moisture and vegetation optical depth.</p>
<p>The SMAP spacecraft carries two instruments, a radar (active) and a radiometer (passive), that together make global measurements of land surface soil moisture and freeze/thaw state. It is useful for monitoring and predicting natural hazards such as floods and droughts, understanding the linkages between Earthâ€™s water, energy and carbon cycles, and reducing uncertainties in predicting weather and climate.</p>
