<p>Temporal coverage: 31 March 2015 - present</p>
<p>The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) &quot;Uncorrected Brightness Temperature 9 km QA” layers display quality assurance (QA) flags for uncorrected brightness temperatures (TBs) posted to a 9 km EASE-Grid 2.0 for the vertical (V) polarization of the fore scan from the SMAP radiometer.</p>
<p>Within the image, green indicates that TB observations have acceptable quality for science use, yellow indicates that caution should be used with the TB observations as one or more quality-impacting conditions have been identified, and red indicates that TB observations are flagged as bad due to unacceptable quality.</p>
