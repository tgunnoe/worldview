<p>Temporal Coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 3 July 2002 - present (Aqua)</p>
<p>The MODIS Cloud Multi Layer Flag layer indicates the detection of multi layer clouds from MODIS shortwave observations expressed through 9 categories ranging from single layer cloud to the lowest confidence multi-layer cloud to the highest confidence multi-layer cloud with a range of intermediary confidence levels. This layer is useful for identifying areas of cloud overlap and flagging pixels where cloud microphysical retrievals would be adversely affected by cloud overlap.</p>
<p>The MODIS Cloud Multi Layer Flag layer is available from both the Terra (MOD06) and Aqua (MYD06) satellites for daytime overpasses. The sensor resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) for Terra is 24 February 2000 and Aqua is 3 July 2002 - present.</p>
