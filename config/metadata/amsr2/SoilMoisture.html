<p>Temporal Coverage: 24 July 2012 - Present (Day); 23 July 2012 - Present (Night)</p>
<p>The AMSR2 Soil Moisture Normalized Polarization Difference layer indicates the amount of soil moisture over land masses in grams per cubic centimeters (g/cm<sup>3</sup>). The imagery resolution is 25 kilometers, and the temporal resolution is daily. This layer is available for both day, July 24, 2012 to present, and night, July 23, 2012 to present, for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). This layer was constructed by using the Normalized Polarization Difference (NPD) algorithm using resampled brightness temperature data.</p>
<p>The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument provides global passive microwave measurements. It is a remote sensing instrument that measures weak microwave emissions from the surface and the atmosphere of the Earth. AMSR2 also provides microwave emission and scattering intensity measurements.</p>
