<p>Temporal coverage: 13 January 2016 - present</p>
<p>The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) &quot;Sea Ice Concentration, 12km&quot; layer displays the percent of sea ice concentration in the Polar regions at a 12.5 km resolution.</p>
<p>Sea ice concentration describes the relative amount of area covered by ice, compared to some reference area and usually reported as a percentage. In this case, the relative area is a 12.5 km x 12.5 km swath.</p>
<p>The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument is a conically scanning passive microwave radiometer sensing microwave radiation at 12 channels and 6 frequencies ranging from 6.9 to 89 GHz on board the Global Change Observation Mission – Water 1 (GCOM-W1) satellite. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 12.5 km. The temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 13 January 2016 - present.</p>
