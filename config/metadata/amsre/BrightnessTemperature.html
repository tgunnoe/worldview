<p>Temporal coverage: 18 June 2002 - 4 October 2011</p>
<p>The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) &quot;Brightness Temperature&quot; layers display brightness temperatures (TBs) in kelvins for the 89 GHz horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarizations for the 1:30 a.m. ascending (day) and the 1:30 p.m. descending (night) half-orbit passes of the AMSR-E radiometer B feedhorn. Brightness temperature is the product of a body&#39;s physical temperature multiplied by its emissivity at a given wavelength. The 89 GHz TBs are provided in their native resolution of 5.4 km.  The AMSR-E TB product also contains 89 GHz TBs resampled to the coarser resolutions of the other AMSR-E channels.</p>
<p>On board NASA&#39;s Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric variables used to investigate global water and energy cycles. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 5.4 km. The temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 18 June 2002 - 4 October 2011.</p>
