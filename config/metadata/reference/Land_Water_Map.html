<p>The Land/Water Map base layer is a representation of land in dark grey and water in light grey.  It was created to provide a neutral-colored base layer for context underneath the oftentimes more colorful overlays.</p>
<p>The Land/Water Map was gleaned from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p>
