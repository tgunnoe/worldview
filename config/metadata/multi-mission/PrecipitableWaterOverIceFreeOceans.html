<p>Temporal Coverage: January 1988 - August 2016</p>
<p>The RSS Precipitable Water over Ice-Free Oceans layer indicates the average amount of total precipitable water within a month in kilograms per meters squared over ocean areas that are not covered in ice. The imagery resolution is about 1 degree, or about 111 kilometers, and the temporal resolution is monthly. This layer is also available from January 1988 through August 2016 for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and was constructed using data collected from all of the SSM/I, SSMIS F16, SSMIS F17, AMSR-E, AMSR-2, and WindSat instruments. This layer was constructed by first creating a monthly water vapor 1-degree map from each satellite. Then, quality control measures were applied to this map and combined with total precipitable water measurements from each instrument to output this layer.</p>
<p>The Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) is a seven channel passive microwave radiometer operating at four frequencies and dual-polarization. The Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) is also a microwave radiometer that includes a sounder. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a twelve-channel, six-frequency, total power passive-microwave radiometer. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is a remote sensing instrument measuring weak microwave emissions from the surface and the atmosphere of the Earth providing microwave emission and scattering intensity measurements. Finally, WindSat is a polarimetric microwave radiometer which measures ocean surface wind vectors.</p>
